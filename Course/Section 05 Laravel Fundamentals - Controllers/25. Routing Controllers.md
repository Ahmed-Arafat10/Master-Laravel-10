- After creating a `controller`,
  you can access it & call its functions from `route`,
  just make the `second` `parameter` the `Full Path` to `controller` file, then type `@` then the name of that function,
  like this:

````php
Route::get('/testcont','\App\Http\Controllers\PostController@index');
````

#### - To make typing the `controller` much more easy task, you can define the whole path just once, like this

````php
use \App\Http\Controllers\PostController;
Route::get('/testcont1',[PostController::class,'index']);
````
