- Now we will create a `route` to update the name of a role
  in `mtm_roles` table, while searching with `ID` of the user

````php
Route::get('/mtm_update_user_role', function () {
    $user = mtm_user::findOrFail(1);
    if ($user->has('mtm_Role')) {
        foreach ($user->mtm_role as $single) {
            if ($single->name == "Front-End Developer") {
                $single->name = "Updated Front-End Developer";
                $single->save();
            }
        }
    }
});
````

> `has('ModelName')` function check if that user has a relationship
> with table `mtm_Role`, because I can find an `ID` of a user who have not any relationship with `roles`
(he hasn't been assigned to any role yet), if so I will iterate on each object array (row) in that collection
> , then I'm checking if the name attribute if `Front-End Developer` then I will change it then save that change in
> the `database`
