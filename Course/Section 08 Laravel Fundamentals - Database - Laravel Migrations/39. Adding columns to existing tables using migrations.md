- In this video we will learn how to add a new `column` to a `table` without
  having to drop the whole `table` using `php artisan migrate:rollback`
- This is not feasible as this table may contain `records` which will be deleted

- To do this type

````php
php artisan make:migration add_is_admin_column --table="posts"
````

> Note: you can type `--table=posts` without quotes

- In `add_is_admin_column.php` file the following code will be created

````php
return new class extends Migration {
/**
* Run the migrations.
*
* @return void
*/
public function up()
{
    Schema::table('posts', function (Blueprint $table) {
    // add a new column called `is_admin`
    //$table->integer('is_admin')->unsigned();// unsigned means positive numbers only as you already know
    $table->tinyInteger('is_admin')->default('0');
    });
}
    /**
     * Reverse the migrations.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function down()
    {
        Schema::table('posts', function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table->dropColumn('is_admin');
        });
    }
};
````

> Observe the methods `unsigned()` & `default('0')`

- Then type the following command

````php
php artisan migrate
````

> As we said before `php artisan migrate` execute all latest migration files

- Again to undo last migration type

````php
php artisan migrate:rollback
````
