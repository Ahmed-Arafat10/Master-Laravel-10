- In the video the instructor wrote the following command to create
  a registration & login system

````php
php artisan make:auth 
````

> But this command is for `Laravel 5.2` and below

- for `Laravel 6 >=`, type :

````php
composer require laravel/ui
````

- Then

````php
php artisan ui vue --auth
````

- Then

````php
php artisan migrate
````

- Now all `Authentication` pages exist, but to work you have to
  write the following command

````php
npm install && npm run dev
````

> Install `npm` then run `dev`
