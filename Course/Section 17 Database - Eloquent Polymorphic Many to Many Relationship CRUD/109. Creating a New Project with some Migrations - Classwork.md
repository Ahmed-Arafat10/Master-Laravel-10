### Creating a New Project with some Migrations - Classwork

Let's learn so more about `Polymorphic` relationships but this one will be the `Many to Many`.

> NOTE: There is no need to add increment ids on pivot tables unless you plan to access them directly. I include them in
> the video but if you want to omit them in your projects that will fine.

Summary:

We creating a Laravel Project with the database, 4 `models` and 4 `migrations`.

1. Create a new Laravel installation called `polymorphicmanytomany`

2. Create a database with the same name `polymorphicmanytomany`

3. Create 4 models, `Post`, `Video`, `Tag` and `Taggable`; here is a reminder of how we do that below

````php
php artisan make:model poly_mtm_post -m
````

````php
php artisan make:model poly_mtm_video -m
````

````php
php artisan make:model poly_mtm_tag -m
````

````php
php artisan make:model poly_mtm_taggable -m
````

4. Edit your migrations. By default we know the migrations will have $table->id(), but in the video, you might see me
   having the `$table->increments('id')`, but no worries they are almost the same thing, behind the scenes the $table->
   id() is `$table->bigIncrements('id')` behind the scenes..

The Migration create_posts_table.php of the `Post` model needs to have the below data.

````php
$table->id()
$table->string('name')
$table->timestamps()
````

5. The same thing for the migration create_videos_table.php of the `Video` model.

````php
$table->id()
$table->string('name')
$table->timestamps()
````

6. The same thing for the migration create_tags_table.php of the `Tag` model.

````php
$table->id()
$table->string('name')
$table->timestamps()
````

7. For the create_taggables_table.php migration of the `Taggable` model, we need this

````php
$table->id()
$table->integer('tag_id')
$table->integer('taggable_id')
$table->string('taggable_type')
$table->timestamps()
````

Alright, I hope you enjoy and try to keep practicing yourself with it, to see how things work.
