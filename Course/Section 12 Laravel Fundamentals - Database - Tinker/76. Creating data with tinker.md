- `Tinker` is a command that works with `php artisan` command,
  it allows us to interact with `Database`, we can create objects from database tables
  then we can perform all `CRUD` Operations & also we can check the `relationships`
  between tables without using or writing any `routes`
- It is used for debugging and testing not for creating a whole project using it
- To use it type

```php
php artisan tinker
```

- To insert a new row in `Posts` table

````php
$post = App\Models\Post::create(['title'=>'test tinker','content'=>'test tinker','User_ID'=> 1 ]) 
````

- To print the created row just type the variable name `$post` in `tinker` to print the row

- To create an object of table `Post`

````php
$post1 = new App\Models\Post  
````

- We can assign values to object's attributes (they are the columns of table `posts`)

````php
$post1->title = "tinker's title"
$post1->content = "tinker's content"
$post1->User_ID = 1
$post1->is_admin = 1   
````

- then to view the values for all the attributes of that object just type agian `$post1`

- To save this row in the `Database` type

````php
$post1->save()
````

> Output: `true`
