- we can find relationship with `tinker`

- Remember this method from model class `user`

````php
public function GetUserRoles2()
    {
        return $this->belongsToMany('App\Models\Role')->withPivot('created_at', 'updated_at');
    }
````

- we can view relationship of a record in `users` table with
  `roles` table using pivot table `role_user`

````php
$user1 = App\Models\User::find(2)    
````

````php
$user1->GetUserRoles2  
````

- The output :

````php
 = Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Collection {#4727
    all: [
      App\Models\Role {#4754
        id: 2,
        name: "Subscriber",
        created_at: null,
        updated_at: null,
        pivot: Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\Pivot {#4752
          user_id: 2,
          role_id: 2,
          created_at: "2022-11-09 04:00:37",
          updated_at: null,
        },
      },
      App\Models\Role {#4755
        id: 1,
        name: "administrator ",
        created_at: null,
        updated_at: null,
        pivot: Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\Pivot {#4750
          user_id: 2,
          role_id: 1,
          created_at: "2022-11-04 04:00:42",
          updated_at: null,
        },
      },
    ],
  }
````

> the relationship is `many-to-many`, as one `user` may have many `roles` while a single `role` is used by many `users`
