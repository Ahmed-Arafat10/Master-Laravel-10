- One of the coolest features in `Laravel` is Named Routes
- if you are in `index.blade.php` file with the following code

````php
<a href="/blog">My Blog</a>
````

> What we are doing here we're adding a static link to our path, this could be
> so problematic if we want to change the endpoint of that `route` later

- The simplest way of making these `routes` dynamic is to
  give a name your `routes`

- To do so you first have to name the `route` by chaining the method
  `name()` in your `route`

````php
Route::view('/', 'blog.index');

Route::get('/blog', [PostController::class, 'index'])
    ->name('blog.index');
````

- Now on `blog.index` page

````php
<h1>
    Hello From Index Page
</h1>
<a href="{{ route('blog.index') }}">My Blog</a>
````

> we will refer to our route with its name using global function `route()` instead of using `/blog`

- Now if I changed the endpoint, I will not change anything else in any `view` file

````php
Route::get('/NewBlog', [PostController::class, 'index'])
    ->name('blog.index');
````

- Now let's define a route that takes a parameter

````php
Route::get('/blog/{id}', [PostController::class, 'show'])
    ->name('blog.show');
````

- In `PostController` file

````php
public function show($id)
    {
        return $id;
    }
````

- Now on `blog.index` page

````php
<h1>
    Hello From Index Page
</h1>
<a href="{{ route('blog.index') }}">My Blog</a>
<a href="{{ route('blog.show',['id' => 1]) }}">Show Blog</a>
````

> To pass a parameter to a named route just add an array as a second parameter

- Note: the name of the route is shown when you type `php artisan route:list`


- The method `resource()` creates names for the `routes`

````php
Route::resource('/blog',PostController::class);
````

> Note that `resource()` method automatically create names for each `route`
> by binding the name of the URL + the name of the method in the controller, like `blog.index`,`blog.show` and so on
