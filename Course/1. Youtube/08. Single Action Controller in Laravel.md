- Some `Controllers` use only single route, which means that these `Controllers` will have just one method in it
, in his case we will define a method called `__invoke()` that is called automatically whenever we use the class name
- In `HomeController` file
````php
public function __invoke()
{
    return view('index');
}
````

- Now in the `route` just type
````php
// Route for invoke method
Route::get('/',HomeController);
````
> As you can see we didn't specify the name of the method as it will be automatically invoked
