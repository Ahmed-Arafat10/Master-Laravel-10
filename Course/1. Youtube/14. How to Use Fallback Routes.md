- When a user trys to access a page that is not found,
the `404 Not Found` page will be shown
- When you implement `Fallback Route` it will override the default
`404 Not Found` page

- To do so first create a `controller` that return a `view`
````php
php artisan make:controller FallbackController
````

- Inside that controller create the `invoke()` method (will be executed automatically 
whenever specifying the Controller name)
````php
    public function __invoke()
    {
        return view('fallback.index');
    }
````

- Now in the `web.app`, call the static method `fallback()` then pass controller name
````php
use \App\Http\Controllers\FallbackController;
Route::fallback(FallbackController::class);
````
> As we can see no need to specify the function as `__invoke()` method will be executed automatically

- Now create a folder in the view folder called `fallback` and inside it
a file called `index.blade.php` then add any `HTML` code
````php
<h1>
    Fallback page once a route doesn't exit
</h1>
````

- now if you went to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/nnnn`, it will show the above page
