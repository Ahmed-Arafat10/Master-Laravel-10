- We want for each post to have many categories & of course for each category, there will be many posts
- Make a `category` model + migration
````php
php artisan make:model Category -m
````

- In created migration
````php
public function up(): void
    {
        Schema::create('categories', function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table->id();
            $table->string('title');
            $table->timestamps();
        });
    }
````

- Now create a `Pivot Table` as it is a Many-To-Many relationship
````php
php artisan make:migration create_category_post_table --create=category_post
````
> Note the convention of naming `Pivot Table` is singular name of two tables sorted alphabetically with `_` between them
> So the table will be named `category_post`

- In the created migration
````php
public function up(): void
    {
        Schema::create('category_post', function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table->unsignedBigInteger('post_id');
            $table->unsignedBigInteger('category_id');
            $table->foreign('post_id')
                ->references('id')
                ->on('posts')
                ->onDelete('cascade');
            $table->foreign('category_id')
                ->references('id')
                ->on('categories')
                ->onDelete('cascade');
        });
    }
````
> Just create two columns each is a `FK` referring to `PK` of both tables `post` & `categories`


- Now in `post` model class define relationship
````php
# one post will have many categories
    public function categories()
    {
        return $this->belongsToMany(Category::class);
    }
````
> Method is named `categories()` as one post will have many categories


- Same concept will be applied to category model class
````php
# one category will have many posts
    public function posts()
    {
        return $this->belongsToMany(Post::class);
    }
````
> Method is named `posts()` as one category will have many posts

- In `show.blade` file, add the part that will print all categories for a specific post
````php
    <p class="pt-4 italic">
        Categories: @foreach($SinglePost->categories as $singleCat)
            {{ $singleCat->title  }}
        @endforeach
    </p>
