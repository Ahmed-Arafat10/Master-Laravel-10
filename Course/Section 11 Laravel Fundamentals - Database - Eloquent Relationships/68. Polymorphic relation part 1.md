- `Polymorphic relations` means if there is a table called `photo` having columns:

````
        id|path|imageable_id|imageable_type
        1  /ging     5      App\Models\User
        2  /ging     8      App\Models\Post
````

- The first row means that this photo is for the user with `ID` 5 [From `User` table]
- While the second row means that this photo is for the post with `ID` 8 [From `Post` table]

- To do this first we create a migration file for `Photo` table

````shell
php artisan make:model Photo -m
````

- Then we add new columns in the table in its migration file

````php 
public function up()
  {
  Schema::create('photos', function (Blueprint $table) {
  $table->id();
  $table->string('path');
  $table->integer('imageable_id');// this could be the ID of user's photo or post's photo depending on `imageable_type`
  column
  $table->string('imageable_type');// this column define type it could be [App\Models\User] or [App\Models\Post]
  $table->timestamps();
  });
  }
````

- Then write

````
php artisan migrate
````

> to execute the migration
