- To validate some `inputs`, go to the method in the `controller`
  that deals with `$request` object of class `Requeest` then add the
  following code:

````php
  public function store(Request $request)
    {
        $this->validate($request, [
            'title' => 'required|max:5',
            'content' => 'required|min:2'
        ]);
        post::create($request->all());
        return redirect('/post');
    }
````

> We pass an `array` in the second parameter foo method `validate()`,
> then we specify `name` attribute of each `input` we want to add a validation for as
> a `key` in the `array` that refers on something called `rules` that add a validation to that `input` <br>
> `required` & `max:value` & `min:value` are all called `rules` <br>
> Now when you click on submit button, the form will not send any data, but the problem here is that there
> is no message appears for the user (will be solved in the next video)
