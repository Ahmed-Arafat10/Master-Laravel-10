- First go to [Here](https://laravelcollective.com/docs/6.x/html) to install the `laravelcollective/html` package, but
  first
  we have to update the `composer`

````
composer update
````

- Then type in the terminal

````php
composer require laravelcollective/html
````

> Remember: This is done inside the folder of `laravel`

- Then go to `create.blade.php` and add the following

````php
{!! Form::open() !!}
````

> instead of `<form method="POST" action="/post">--}}`

- Difference between `{{ }}` & `{!! !!}` is that Blade's `{{ }}`
  statements are automatically sent through `PHP`'s `htmlentities`
  function to prevent `XSS` attacks.
- If you pass data from your `Controller` to a `View` with some `HTML` styling like:

````php
$first = "<b>Ahmed Arafat</b>";
````

- And it is accessed, within Blade, with `{{ $first }}` then the output will be just text `<b>Narendra Sisodia</b>`
- But if it is accessed with `{!! $first !!}` then the output will be "<b>Ahmed Arafat</b>"
