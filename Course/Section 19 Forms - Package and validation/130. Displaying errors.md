- There is a `Global Array` that is accessible in all files called
  `$errors`, in this `array` all validation errors are stored in this `array`,
  to be able to use this `array` we have to put our `Route::resource('/post', PostController::class);`
  in a `middleware` called `web` (we will take about it in details later), do it like this :

````php
Route::group(['middleware' => 'web'], function () {
    Route::resource('/post', PostController::class);
});
````

- Now in `create.blade.php` page, we will add the below code to print the errors to the user

````php
    @if(count($errors) > 0)
        <ul class="alert alert-danger">
            @foreach($errors->all() as $SingleError)
                <li>{{$SingleError}}</li>
            @endforeach
        </ul>
    @endif
````
