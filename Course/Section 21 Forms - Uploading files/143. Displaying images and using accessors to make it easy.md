- What we want now to do is to show the stores images in the folder `images`
  in page `index.balde.php`, so we will type the following code

````php
@section('content')
    <ul>
        @foreach($AllPosts as $post)
            <div class="image-container">
                <img height="100" width="100" src="/images/{{$post->path}}" alt="N/A">
            </div>
            <li>
                <a href="{{route('post.show',$post->id)}}"> Title: {{$post->title}} & Content: {{$post->content}} </a>
            </li>
        @endforeach
    </ul>
@endsection
````

- To write the folder in which the file or image is stored, we can use
  `Accessors`, so that we don't have to type the folder each time, now in
  the `controller` add the following method :

````php
public $directory = '/images/';
public function getPathAttribute($value)
    {
        return $this->directory . $value;
    }
````

> Now I can type  `src="{{$post->path}}"` instead of ` src="/images/{{$post->path}}"` <br>
> Now when I change the Folder later
> I will just change the value in the attribute `$directory` instead of editing it
> in each part in the code, this will hugely save time & effort
