- You are going to see me using it to show you how to upload files, so I'm creating this small article to show you how
  to create a regular form for uploads without using any type of package just in case you want to use this form instead.

- Example of a regular form for files:

````php
<form action="/uploadfile" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
    @csrf
    <div class="form-group">
        <input type="file" class="form-control-file" name="fileToUpload" id="exampleInputFile">
    </div>
    <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Submit</button>
</form>
