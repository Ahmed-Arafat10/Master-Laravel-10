- To turn `Laravel` project to `Maintenance` mode type in the terminal

````php
php artisan down
````

> Now if you went to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` the result will be `503 | SERVICE UNAVAILABLE`

- To make it live again type

````php
php artisan up
````

- Now to use a `Middleware` you have many ways, first one
  is to access it in the `Controller` like in `HomeControler.php`
  type the following :

````php
public function __construct()
    {
        $this->middleware('auth');
    }
````

- The second way is to write this in the `route`

````php
Route::get('/testmiddleware', function () {
    
})->middleware('testmymiddleware')->name('MyRoute');
````

- Now in the `RoleMiddleware.php` file

````php
public function handle(Request $request, Closure $next)
    {
        echo "Middleware is Working";
        return $next($request);
    }
````

> When you go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/testmiddleware`, the result will be in
> the browser `Middleware is Working`

- Now in the `RoleMiddleware.php` file

````php
public function handle(Request $request, Closure $next)
    {
        return redirect('/');
        return $next($request);
    }
````

> When you go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/testmiddleware`, then you will be redirected to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`

- To use multiple `Middlewares`, write this in the `route`

````php
Route::get('/testmiddleware', function () {
    
})->middleware(['testmymiddleware','auth'])->name('MyRoute');
````
