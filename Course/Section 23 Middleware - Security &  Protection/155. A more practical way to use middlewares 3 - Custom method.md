- The second way to use `Middlewares` is to access them
  inside a controller
- Let's create an `AdminController` file

````php
php artisan make:controller AdminController
````

- Now if the `RoleMiddleware` is like this

````php
public function handle(Request $request, Closure $next)
    {
        $user = Auth::user();
        if ($user->isAdmin()) echo "Hello Admin";
        else return redirect('/');
        return $next($request);
    }
````

> If the logged-in user is not an admin then he will be
> redirected to '/'

- In the created `Controller` if you want to access the
  role `Middleware`, then type this

````php
class AdminController extends Controller
{
    public function __construct()
    {
        return $this->middleware('role');
    }
    
    public function index()
    {
        echo "I can access this method if I'm Admin";
    }
}
````

> Now each method in `AdminController` will first be redirected
> to the `RoleMiddleware` that check if the user is admin & if not
> the user will be redirected to `/`, so each user who is not an admin
> cannot access any method inside `AdminController`

- Finally create a `route` that call `AdminController@index`

````php
Route::get('/test2', [AdminController::class, 'index'], function () {

});
````
