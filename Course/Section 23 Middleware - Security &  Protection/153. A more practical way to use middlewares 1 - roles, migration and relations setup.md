- Now we will create a `role` table, then we will use `Middleware`
  to check if the user has a role of admin & subscriber

````php
php artisan make:model Role -m
````

- Then add the column `role_id` to `User` migration file

````php
$table->integer('role_id');
````

- Then add the column `name` to `Role` migration file

````php
$table->string('name');
````

- Then refresh the migrations

````php
php artisan migrate:refresh
````

- Then make `name` column fillable in `Role` model

````php
protected $fillable  = ['name'];
````

- Finally, in `User` model add the following function

````php
public function role()
    {
        return $this->belongsTo(role::class);
    }
````

> as the table `user` will contain the foreign key `role_id`
