- Let's create a `route` to read data from `ztmp_posts` table

````php
Route::get("/view_user_ztmp_post", function () {
    $user = ztmp_user::findOrFail(1);
    dd($user->ztemp_post);
    foreach ($user->ztemp_post as $SinglePost) {
        echo $SinglePost->body . "<br>";
    }
});
````

> `Vip Note` : function `dd()` is used to print the data for
> either a `object` or a `collection`, a `collection` is an object of objects
> where at each `index` it stores an object, for example when you get a single user
> then its data is stored in an `array`, but when you get from `database` all posts posted by a specific user
> then the result will be stored in an `collection`
> So, when we use `foreach` we iterate on each index in that `collection`
(we iterate over each row), then printing its corresponding body
