- Assume you have a record in `poly_photos` having the following :

````php
3 Zodiac.gif NULL NULL NULL 2023-01-05 08:00:30
````

> Observe that `imageable_id` & `imageable_type` are `NULL`, this means that
> we have an image but this image is not assigned yet either to a `staff` or `product`

- Let's create a `route`

````php
Route::get('/assign', function () {
    $staff = poly_staff::findOrFail(1);
    $image = \App\Models\poly_photo::findOrFail(3);// ID of that record
    $staff->image()->save($image);
});
````

> The expected output on that record after visiting `http://127.0.0.1:8000/assign` will be

````php
3   Zodiac.gif  1   App\Models\poly_staff   NULL    2023-01-05 08:06:54
````

- To reset the value of `imageable_id` & `imageable_type` for a record, create a `route`

````php
Route::get('/reassign', function () {
    $staff = poly_staff::findOrFail(1);
    $staff->image()->whereId(3)->update(['imageable_id' => NULL, 'imageable_type' => NULL]);
    //Or
    //$staff->image()->update(['imageable_id' => NULL, 'imageable_type' => NULL]);
});
````

> `whereId(3)` is the `ID` for that record in `poly_photos` table
> Commented line can also be used if `image()` method will return
> only one record otherwise use `whereId(ID)` to get that row `ONLY`
