- Now create a new `route`

````php
Route::get('poly_read', function () {
    $staff = poly_staff::findOrFail(1);
    foreach ($staff->image as $i) {
        echo $i;
        //echo $i->path;
    }
});
````

> `O/P` after visiting `http://127.0.0.1:8000/poly_read`

````php
{"id":1,"path":"Ging.png","imageable_id":1,"imageable_type":"App\\Models\\poly_staff","created_at":"2023-01-05T02:27:49.000000Z","updated_at":"2023-01-05T02:27:49.000000Z"}

> `VIP` Note: this is a `one-to-one polymorphic relationship`, which means that each `staff` will have a one image
> & each `product` will also have only one image

> In the next section we will discuss `many-to-many polymorphic relationship`
