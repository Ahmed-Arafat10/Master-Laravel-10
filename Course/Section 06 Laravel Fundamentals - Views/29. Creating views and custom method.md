- All the views in laravel are located in `resource` > `views`
- Also, you can create a folder and put inside it your `views` file
- As we said before `views` are representation of your page, like `HTML`,`CSS` & `JS` and so on
- extension of a `view` is `.blade.php`

> `blade` is a template engine that allows us to write shortcut code of `php` (we will
> see an example)

- Now create a file called `contact.blade.php` in `view` folder & then write in it `HTML`

- Create a function in your `controller` file that return a `view` called `contact`, like this:

````php
function ContactPage()
    {
        return view('contact');
    }
````

- Then in `web.app` file write the following `route` to call `ContactPage()` function from `PostController.php` file

````php
Route::get('/contact',[PostController::class,'ContactPage']);
````

> Now whenever request is sent to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/contact` URL it will call `ContactPage()` that will return
> the `view` which is
> called `contact`
