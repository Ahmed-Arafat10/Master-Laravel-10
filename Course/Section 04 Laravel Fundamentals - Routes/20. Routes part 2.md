- You can pass parameters in your `URL` using `route`
- To add a get variable in `URL` type:

````php
URL/{VariableName}
````

- You have also to add a `parameter` to the `closure function`
- It doesn't matter if these `parameter` having the same name as in `URL` or not
  , but a good practicing is to have the same name,so you don't be confused

````php
Route::get('/posts/{id}',function ($id)
{
   return "Post number : " . $id;
});
````

- You can add more than one variable in `URL`, just add `/` between them

````php
Route::get('/human/{age}/{name}',function ($age,$name)
{
    return "My name is " . $name . " My age is " . $age;
});
````
