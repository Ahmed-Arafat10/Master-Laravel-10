- Inside `routes` > `web.php` you can add your `route`
- `Route` is class & `get()` is a static method
- It means that when you type following `GET` request in the `URL` this function will be executed
- The Function inside the parameter is called `closure function`
- Each route returns a `view`
- A `view` is `HTML` representation of your page

<hr>

- `Routes` are created like this:

````php
Route::get('/', function () {
    return view('welcome');
});
````

````php
Route::get('/hello',function (){
    return "Hello Laravel";
});
````

````php
Route::get('/admin/test',function (){
    return "Hello Admin";
});
````
