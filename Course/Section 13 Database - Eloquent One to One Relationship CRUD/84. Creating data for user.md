- Now we want to create a `route` to insert the data in
  `address` table when visiting the URL

````php
use App\Models\ztmp_address;

Route::get('/insert_user_address', function () {
    $user = User::findOrFail(1);

    $address = new ztmp_address(['name' => 'El-Haram']);
    $user->address()->save($address);
});
````

> `$address = new ztmp_address(['name' => 'El-Haram']);` here we have created
> an object from class model `ztmp_address` & sending the attributes of the table as an array parameter

- VIP Note: we have to make the columns we want to insert a data in it `fillable`,to do so
  we have to add the `array fillable` in `address.php class model`

````php
 protected $fillable = [
        'name'
    ];
````
