- Again write a `route` to get the address of a specific user
  using his `ID`

````php
Route::get('/read_user_address', function () {
    $user = User::findOrFail(1);
    echo $user->address->name;
});
````

- Write another `route` to `delete` the address of a specific user
  using his `ID`

````php
Route::get('/delete_user_address', function () {
    $user = User::findOrFail(1);
    $user->address->delete();
});
