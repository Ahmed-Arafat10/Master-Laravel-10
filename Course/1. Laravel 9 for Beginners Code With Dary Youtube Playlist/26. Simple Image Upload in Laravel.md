- Let's create a function to store the images in `PostController`, it is `private` as we will use it just in that `controller` 
````php
private function storeImage(Request $request)
    {
        $newImage = uniqid() . '_' . $request->title . '.' . $request->image->extension();
        $request->image->move(public_path('images'),$newImage);
        return $newImage;// Just return the new name of the file
    }
````
> Note: the `$request` is sent as a parameter <br>
> Don't forget, `image` is the name of input tag of the image <br>
> `public_path('images')` will create a folder called `images` in the folder `public`, which contains all folders & files that can be accessed by the user

- Now all you have to do is to call the above function, like this
````php
Post::create([
            'title' => $request->title,
            'excerpt' => $request->excerpt,
            'body' => $request->body,
            'image_path' => $this->storeImage($request),
            'is_published' => $request->is_published === 'on',
            'min_to_read' => $request->min_to_read,
            'user_id' => 1,
        ]);
````

- Now in `index.blade.php`, add `<img>` tag
````php
@if($SinglePost->image_path !== null)
     <img height="100px" width="100px" src="/images/{{$SinglePost->image_path}}" alt="" >
@endif
````
> The problem here is path `/images/` is static, which means that if I want to change it, then I will have to change it in each occurrence which will be a headache

<hr>

- From another course I have learned the `Accessors`, which will print the name of the image + the path before it
- In post model class :
````php
    private $dir = '/images/';
    public function getImagePathAttribute($value)
    {
        return $this->dir . $value;
    }
````
> Note that column name is `image_name`, Naming of the function is like this `get` + Capital case of first character (`ImagePath`) + `Attribute`
