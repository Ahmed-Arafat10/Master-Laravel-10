- `Laravel`'s most important feature  is Eloquent
- Eloquent  is an active record optional relational mapper which helps you interact with the Database a lot easier
- Eloquent is used often more than query builder
- Whenever you want to use Eloquent, the interaction goes with a `Model`

- To make a model
````php
php artisan make:model ModelName
````

- Lets see the post model file
````php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Factories\HasFactory;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Post extends Model
{
    use HasFactory;
}
````
> Laravel knows the name of your table from the name of your model class `Post`

- If you want to specify the name of the table (if the name of the class is different from the name of the table)
````php
    protected $table = 'posts';
````
> Just add the above attribute

- By default, the column `id` is known by laravel as the Primary Key, if ypu want to change it
````php
    protected $primaryKey = 'post_id';
````

- As we know `$table->timestamps();` in the migration creates `created_at` & `updated_at` columns
- Instead of deleting the columns, you can disable them
````php
    public $timestamps = false;
````

- To specify the Datetime format of the timestamp
````php
    protected $dateFormat = 'YourFormat';
````

- As we know we have defined our Database configuration in `.env` file
- If you want to use a specific driver for a specific model (table)
````php
    protected $connection = 'sqlite';
````

- The power of the databases is the fact that the user can add values for every single column
- But there might be a chance where you want to simply add a default value for a column
````php
    protected $attributes = [
        'is_published' => true
    ];
````
> Here the default value for `is_published` column is `true` <br>
> As you know you can specify the default value of a column in the migration using `->default(1);`
