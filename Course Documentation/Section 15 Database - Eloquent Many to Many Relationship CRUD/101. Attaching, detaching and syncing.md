- Let's observe 3 functions `attach()`/`detach()`/`sync()`

- Let's create a `route` functions `attach()`

````php
Route::get('/attach', function () {
    $user = mtm_user::findOrFail(1);
    $user->mtm_role()->attach(16);
});
````

> this route will create a new record in `mtm_role_user` between
> user with `ID = 1` & roles with `ID = 16`

> Note: for every reload to URL `http://127.0.0.1:8000/attach`, it will create a new record

- Now Let's create a `route` functions `detach()`

````php
Route::get('/detach', function () {
    $user = mtm_user::findOrFail(1);
    $user->mtm_role()->detach(16);
});

````

> This route will create delete `All` record(s) in `mtm_role_user` between
> user with `ID = 1` & roles with `ID = 16`

- Finally, create a `route` functions `sync()`

````php
Route::get('/sync', function () {
    $user = mtm_user::findOrFail(1);
    $user->mtm_role()->sync([17]);// must pass an array
});
````

> The `sync()` method accepts an array as an argument. As the name suggests, this method synchronizes the database
> entries that means whatever you pass in this method, those records will be kept into the database and the rest will be
> removed from the `intermediate(pivot)` table.
