- Now create a `route` to update a record in `address` table

````php
Route::get('/update_user_address', function () {
    //$address = ztmp_address::where('user_id',1);
    //$address = ztmp_address::where('user_id',">=",1);
    $address = ztmp_address::whereUserId(1)->first();
    $address->name = "updated row1";
    $address->save();
});
````
