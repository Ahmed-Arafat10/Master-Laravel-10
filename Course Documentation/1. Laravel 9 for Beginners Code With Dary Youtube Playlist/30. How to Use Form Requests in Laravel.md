- While working inside a `Controller`, you will observe that there is patterns of code
you are repeating, for example something like `validate()` method will be repeated in many methods in the same `Controller` & there will be an overlap between the `rules` you want to set
- We can use `form request` to specify both the authentication & the rules for each request
- `form request` is a custom request class that is created through `php artisan` used to validate the request
- Now create a new `form request`
````php
php artisan make:request PostFormReqest
````
> The file will be created in `app` > `Requests` folder

- Inside `PostFormReqest`
````php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Requests;

use Illuminate\Foundation\Http\FormRequest;

class PostFormRequest extends FormRequest
{
    /**
     * Determine if the user is authorized to make this request.
     */
    public function authorize(): bool
    {
        return false;
    }

    /**
     * Get the validation rules that apply to the request.
     *
     * @return array<string, \Illuminate\Contracts\Validation\Rule|array|string>
     */
    public function rules(): array
    {
        return [
            //
        ];
    }
}
````
> Turn `false` to `true` in `authorize()` method

- Now I want to add new rules, but the problem here is that each method in `PostController` has it its own rules, but there is a common between them
- For example the image is required in `store()` method but not required in `update()` method
- So add the following code to `rules()` method
````php
public function rules(): array
    {
        $rules = [
            'title' => 'required|max:255|unique:posts,title,' . $this->id ,
            'excerpt' => 'required',
            'body' => 'required',
            'image_path' => ['mimes:jpq,png,jpeg', 'max:5048'],
            'min_to_read' => 'min:0|max:60',
        ];

        # add required for image if the method is post ( in case of store() method )
        if (in_array($this->method(), ['POST'])) $rules['image_path'] = ['required', 'mimes:jpq,png,jpeg', 'max:5048'];
        //if($this->method() == 'POST') $rules['image'] = ['required','mimes:jpq,png,jpeg', 'max:5048'];
        return $rules;
    }
````

- Now all you have to do is to change the class of the Request to `PostFormRequest`, then use method `validated()` instead of `validate([])`
````php
public function update(PostFormRequest $request, string $id)
    {
        $request->validated();
        $arr = $request->except([
            '_token', '_method'
        ]);
        $arr['user_id'] = 1;
        Post::where('id', $id)->update($arr);
        return redirect(route('ViewAllPosts'));
    }
````
