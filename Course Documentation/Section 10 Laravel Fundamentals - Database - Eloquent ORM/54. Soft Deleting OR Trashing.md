- `Soft Deleting` a record means there is a column that indicates the TIME at which this column is deleted, if this
  column in NULL then this column is not deleted yet, so it is actually not a real deleting unless we deleted the
  soft deleted records. It is something like trash in different operating systems
- to do such thing we must include following line in `Post.php` model class

````php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\SoftDeletes;

# then add following code in post class

# use SoftDeletes;

# protected $dates = ['deleted_at'];// to treat this column as a timestamp

// now you have to create a migration file to add the new column in posts table
return new class extends Migration {
    /**
     * Run the migrations.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function up()
    {
        Schema::table('posts', function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table->softDeletes();// will create a column called `deleted_at` with datatype timestamp
        });
    }

    /**
     * Reverse the migrations.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    // note that this function is executed when you execute migrate:rollback command
    public function down()
    {
        Schema::table('posts', function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table->dropColumn('deleted_at');
        });
    }
};
````

- now all we have to do is to create a route that normally delete the row

````php
// soft delete of a row (as we know it will not actually delete it will just add delete time in `deleted_at` column)
Route::get('/elo_softdelete', function () {
    return Post::find(11)->delete();
});
````

> Note: if you read records of `posts` table using `select *` then all soft deleted records
> will not be shown in the query result BY DEFAULT
