- `Accessors` means that we can manipulate the data that comes from the
  `database` before showing it & also without changing the data stored in
  `database`, this like making all characters uppercase before showing it to
  the user after fetching from `Database`.
- While the `Mutators` is that the functionality that we can use to
  set the values to specific form before sending & saving it in the `database`,
  like making all the characters lowercase before sending it to `DB`

- First we will create a `route`

````php
Route::get('/getname', function () {
    $user = \App\Models\User::findOrFail(1);
    echo $user->name;
});
````

- But first we have to go to `User` Model Class & then add the following function

````php
public function getNameAttribute($value)
    {
        return ucfirst($value); // ahmed arafat -> Ahmed Arafat
    }
````

> `VIP Note`: we have to follow a predefined convention, first we use keyword `get` then name of the column
> the `database` in `Camel Case` finally the keyword `Attribute` in `Camel Case` also <br>
> again we didn't change any values in the `Database` itself
