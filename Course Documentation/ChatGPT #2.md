#### Q1: Session::flash() vs Session::put() in laravel 9
In Laravel 9, both `Session::flash()` and `Session::put()` are used to store data in the session. However, they have different purposes.

`Session::put()` is used to store data in the session for the long term. This means that the data will be available in the session until it is manually removed or until the session expires.

On the other hand, `Session::flash()` is used to store data in the session for the short term. This means that the data will only be available in the session for the next request, after which it will be automatically removed from the session.

`Session::flash()` is commonly used to store success or error messages to be displayed to the user on the next page load. For example:

```php
Session::flash('success', 'Your profile has been updated successfully.');
```

This message will be available in the session for the next request, after which it will be automatically removed.

`Session::put()` is used to store data that needs to be persisted across requests, such as user preferences or settings. For example:

```php
Session::put('user.timezone', 'America/New_York');
```

This data will be available in the session until it is manually removed or until the session expires.

In summary, `Session::flash()` is used for short-term storage of data that only needs to be available for the next request, while `Session::put()` is used for long-term storage of data that needs to be persisted across requests.

#### Q2: so now whether ->with() method is long term or short term session
The `->with()` method in Laravel is used to add data to the session flash data, which means that the data will be available in the session for the short term, i.e., only for the next request.

For example, when you redirect a user to a new page after submitting a form, you can use the `->with()` method to flash a success message to the user that will be available on the next request:

```php
return redirect()->route('dashboard')->with('success', 'Your profile has been updated successfully.');
```

In this case, the 'success' message will be available in the session only for the next request. Once the user loads the next page, the message will be removed from the session.

So to answer your question, the `->with()` method is used for short-term session storage.

#### Q3: okay now that is the difference between Session::put() and session()->put() in laravel 9
In Laravel 9, there is no functional difference between `Session::put()` and `session()->put()` because both methods are used to store data in the session for the long term.

`Session::put()` is a static method that is provided by the `Illuminate\Support\Facades\Session` facade. It can be used anywhere in your Laravel application by importing the Session facade, like so:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Session;

Session::put('user.timezone', 'America/New_York');
```

On the other hand, `session()->put()` is a helper function that is provided by Laravel's global helper functions. It can be used anywhere in your Laravel application without the need to import any facade, like so:

```php
session()->put('user.timezone', 'America/New_York');
```

Both methods will store the 'America/New_York' value under the 'user.timezone' key in the session, which will be available for the long term until it is manually removed or the session expires.

In summary, there is no functional difference between `Session::put()` and `session()->put()` in Laravel 9. You can use either of them based on your preference or coding style.

#### Q4: what is Laravel's global helper functions
Laravel's global helper functions are a set of functions that are available globally throughout your Laravel application without requiring any imports or namespaces. These functions can be accessed from anywhere in your application, including within controllers, views, and routes.

Some of the commonly used global helper functions in Laravel include:

1. `app()`: Returns the application instance.

2. `config()`: Returns the value of the specified configuration variable.

3. `env()`: Returns the value of the specified environment variable.

4. `route()`: Generates a URL for the specified named route.

5. `view()`: Returns a new instance of a view.

6. `abort()`: Throws an HTTP exception with the specified status code.

7. `redirect()`: Creates a new redirect response to the specified URL.

8. `session()`: Returns an instance of the session manager.

9. `collect()`: Creates a new collection instance.

10. `request()`: Returns the current request instance.

These global helper functions provide a convenient way to perform common tasks in your Laravel application without the need to import or create instances of classes. However, it's worth noting that overuse of these functions can lead to code that is harder to read and maintain, so it's important to use them judiciously.
<hr>

#### Q5: i want a code example on points 1,2,3,6,9 please
Certainly! Here are some code examples that demonstrate the usage of the global helper functions in Laravel:

1. `app()`

The `app()` function returns an instance of the application container, which can be used to resolve dependencies or fetch instances of registered services:

```php
$myService = app()->make(MyService::class);
```

2. `config()`

The `config()` function returns the value of a specified configuration variable. For example, to retrieve the value of the `app.timezone` configuration variable:

```php
$timezone = config('app.timezone');
```

3. `env()`

The `env()` function returns the value of a specified environment variable. For example, to retrieve the value of the `DB_HOST` environment variable:

```php
$dbHost = env('DB_HOST');
```

6. `abort()`

The `abort()` function is used to throw an HTTP exception with the specified status code. For example, to abort the current request with a 404 status code:

```php
abort(404, 'Page not found');
```

9. `request()`

The `request()` function returns the current request instance, which can be used to retrieve data from the request, such as input values or file uploads:

```php
$name = request()->input('name');
$file = request()->file('image');
```

Note that the `request()` function can also be used to create a new instance of a `Illuminate\Http\Request` object, like so:

```php
$request = request()->create('/my-url', 'POST', ['name' => 'John']);
```

I hope these examples help illustrate how the global helper functions can be used in your Laravel application!

#### Q6: what about collection global helper
Sure! The `collect()` global helper function in Laravel is used to create a new instance of a collection class, which provides a convenient way to work with arrays of data. Here's an example of how to use it:

```php
// A collection ia an array of arrays
$data = [
    ['name' => 'John', 'age' => 32],
    ['name' => 'Mary', 'age' => 25],
    ['name' => 'Peter', 'age' => 40],
];

$collection = collect($data);
 
echo $data[1]['name']; // Mary
 
// Filter the collection to include only people who are over 30 years old
$filtered = $collection->filter(function ($item) {
    return $item['age'] > 30;
});

// Get the names of the filtered items
$names = $filtered->pluck('name');

// Output the result
dd($names); // Outputs: Illuminate\Support\Collection {#3322 â–¼
            //     all: [
            //         "John",
            //         "Peter",
            //     ]
            // }
```

In this example, we're creating a new collection instance from an array of data, and then filtering the collection to include only people who are over 30 years old. We're then using the `pluck()` method to extract the names of the filtered items, and finally outputting the result.

The `collect()` function is a powerful tool for working with data in Laravel, as it provides a wide range of methods for filtering, transforming, and manipulating collections.

#### Q7: what are main methods with collect()
The `collect()` function in Laravel returns an instance of the `Illuminate\Support\Collection` class, which provides a wide range of methods for working with collections of data. Here are some of the main methods you can use:

1. `all()`: Returns all items in the collection as an array.

2. `average($callback = null)`: Returns the average value of all items in the collection. If a callback is provided, it will be used to extract a value for each item.

3. `count()`: Returns the number of items in the collection.

4. `each($callback)`: Applies a callback function to each item in the collection.

5. `filter($callback = null)`: Returns a new collection containing only the items that pass a truth test. If a callback is provided, it will be used as the truth test.

6. `first($callback = null, $default = null)`: Returns the first item in the collection that passes a truth test. If no items pass the test, the `$default` value will be returned. If a callback is not provided, the first item in the collection will be returned.

7. `flatMap($callback)`: Returns a new collection created by applying a callback function to each item in the collection and flattening the results.

8. `map($callback)`: Returns a new collection created by applying a callback function to each item in the collection.

9. `pluck($column)`: Returns a new collection containing the values of a specified column for each item in the collection.

10. `reduce($callback, $initial = null)`: Reduces the collection to a single value by applying a callback function to each item. If an initial value is provided, it will be used as the starting value for the reduction.

11. `reject($callback)`: Returns a new collection containing only the items that fail a truth test.

12. `reverse()`: Returns a new collection with the items in reverse order.

13. `sort($callback = null)`: Returns a new collection sorted by a specified callback function.

14. `sum($callback = null)`: Returns the sum of all items in the collection. If a callback is provided, it will be used to extract a value for each item.

15. `toArray()`: Returns all items in the collection as an array.

These are just a few of the methods available in the `Illuminate\Support\Collection` class. For a complete list of methods, you can refer to the Laravel documentation.

#### Q8: what is callback function in php
In PHP, a callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function or method. The callback function is then called or executed inside the main function or method, usually for a specific purpose.

Callbacks are commonly used in PHP for tasks like filtering and transforming data, handling events, and implementing plugins or extensions. They provide a flexible way to customize the behavior of a function or method without having to modify its code directly.

There are two main types of callbacks in PHP: named functions and anonymous functions (also known as closures). Named functions are regular functions that are defined with a name and can be called by that name from anywhere in the code. Anonymous functions, on the other hand, are functions that are defined inline, without a name, and are usually used only once or in a limited scope.

Here is an example of a callback function in PHP:

```php
function processArray($array, $callback) {
    $result = array();
    foreach($array as $item) {
        $result[] = $callback($item);
    }
    return $result;
}

function multiplyByTwo($number) {
    return $number * 2;
}

$data = array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);

$result = processArray($data, 'multiplyByTwo');

print_r($result);
```

In this example, we have defined a `processArray()` function that takes an array and a callback function as arguments. The function loops through each item in the array and applies the callback function to it, then stores the result in a new array. We have also defined a separate `multiplyByTwo()` function that simply multiplies a given number by two.

We then call the `processArray()` function with our array of data and the `multiplyByTwo()` function as the callback. This results in a new array where each number has been multiplied by two.

Callbacks are a powerful tool in PHP that allow for a wide range of customizations and functionality. They can be used in a variety of contexts, including with arrays, iterators, event listeners, and more.
