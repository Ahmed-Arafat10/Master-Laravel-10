- We can create snippets to make coding much more easy
- This method can be used wih lines of code that are repeated so many times
- To create a snippet in `PhpStorm` go to `settings` >  `live templates`
  then click on plus button then make the abbreviation the shortcut text
  that will be written to instantly show you code, just write the abbreviation
  then hit `tab` button
- For Example : I have created an abbreviation `PRNTERR` that will be evaluated
  with the block of codes that print the errors in `Laravel`, the following code
  will be written instantly

````php
   @if(count($errors) > 0)
        <ul class="alert alert-danger">
            @foreach($errors->all() as $SingleError)
                <li>{{$SingleError}}</li>
            @endforeach
        </ul>
    @endif
````
