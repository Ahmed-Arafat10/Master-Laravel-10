In Laravel, there are typically two common locations for storing files: the `public` folder and the `storage` folder.
Each of these locations serves a specific purpose and has distinct characteristics. Here's a breakdown of the
differences between them:

1. **Public Folder:**

    - **Accessibility:** Files stored in the `public` folder are accessible directly via a web browser. This means that
      if you store a file in the `public` folder, it can be accessed using a URL like `http://yourwebsite.com/file.jpg`.

    - **Usage:** Use the `public` folder for assets that need to be publicly available, such as images, JavaScript
      files, CSS files, and other static assets. These files can be directly linked to in your HTML or included in your
      CSS/JS files.

    - **Example:** You might store user-uploaded profile pictures or publicly available downloadable files in
      the `public` folder.

    - **Caution:** Be careful about storing sensitive or confidential information in the `public` folder, as it's
      accessible to anyone with the URL.

2. **Storage Folder:**

    - **Accessibility:** Files stored in the `storage` folder are not directly accessible via a web browser. They are
      meant for storing private and application-related files that should not be accessed publicly.

    - **Usage:** Use the `storage` folder for storing application-generated files, user-uploaded files that should not
      be publicly accessible, and any other files that should not be served directly to users.

    - **Example:** You might store user-uploaded files that require authentication or authorization to access in
      the `storage` folder.

    - **Access Control:** To serve files from the `storage` folder to users, you typically create routes and controllers
      that handle access control and serve the files indirectly. You might use Laravel's `Storage` facade to manage
      these files.

    - **Security:** By default, files stored in the `storage` folder are not accessible to the public, providing an
      added layer of security for sensitive data.

In summary, the key difference between the `public` folder and the `storage` folder in Laravel is their accessibility.
Use the `public` folder for publicly accessible assets, and use the `storage` folder for files that should not be
directly accessible from the web and require additional control over access. Make sure to implement the necessary access
control mechanisms when serving files from the `storage` folder to maintain security and privacy.
