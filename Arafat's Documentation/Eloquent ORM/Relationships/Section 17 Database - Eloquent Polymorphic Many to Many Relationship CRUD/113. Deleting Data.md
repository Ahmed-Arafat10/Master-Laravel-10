- Create a `route` to delete `Tag id` = `2` that has a relationship with
  `post` with `id`  = `4`

````php
Route::get('/poly_mtm_delete', function () {
    $post = poly_mtm_post::findOrFail(4);
    foreach ($post->tags as $single) {
        if ($single->pivot->tag_id == 2) {
            echo $single->pivot;
            $single->delete();
        }
        echo $single;
    }
});
````

> `$single->delete();` will delete the tag with `ID` = `2`,
> not the `record` in table `poly_mtm_taggables` between it & `post` with `ID` = `4`

- Also, you can delete it like this

````php
$single->whereId(2)->delete();
````
