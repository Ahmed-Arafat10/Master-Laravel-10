- Let's create a `route` to **_delete a role_** from `mtm_roles` table

````php
Route::get('/mtm_delete_user_role', function () {
    $user = mtm_user::findOrFail(1);
    //$user->mtm_role()->delete();
    foreach ($user->mtm_role as $single) {
        $single->whereId('16')->delete();
        //dd($single);
    }
});
````

> `$user->mtm_role()->delete();` will delete all `roles` that have a relationship with that user

> `$single->whereId('16')->delete();` will delete only the role that have `ID` = 16
