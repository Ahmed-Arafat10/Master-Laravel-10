- What I want to do now is to search by a specific `tag` in
  `taggables` table & see if this tag has a relationship with either `video` or `post` tables

````php
use App\Models\Tag;

Route::get('searchbytag/{type}/{tag_id}', function ($type, $tag_id) {
    $tag = Tag::Find($tag_id);
    if ($type == "post") {
        // now I'm printing the posts that have a polymorphic relationship with a specific tag {tag_id}
        // all in `taggables` table
        foreach ($tag->posts as $p) {
            echo $p;
        }
    } else {
        // same as above but this time with video not post
        foreach ($tag->videos as $v) {
            echo $v;
        }
    }
});
