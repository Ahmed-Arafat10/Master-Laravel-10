- `Query Scope` is used to make the shorter code, when you use
  some lines of code in the `controller` that is repeated, you can
  create `Query Scope` in this case

````php
 public function index()
    {
        $AllPosts = post::latest()->get(); // like saying order by desc
        return view('MyPosts.index', compact('AllPosts'));
    }
````

- In `Post` class model we will add the following method

````php
  public function scopeThisIsAhmed($query)
    {
        return $query->orderBy('id', 'desc')->get();
    }
````

> Note: We have to write first the keyword `scope` then the name of the function
> in `Camel Case` then pass `$query` then return the desired code

- Now in the `Controller` we can do that

````php
 public function index()
    {
        $AllPosts = post::thisisahmed();
        return view('MyPosts.index', compact('AllPosts'));
    }
````

> We have called the name of the method without `scope` word & in lowercase
