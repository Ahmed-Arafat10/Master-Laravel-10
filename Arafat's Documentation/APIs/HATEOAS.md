HATEOAS (Hypermedia Controls for APIs)

`HATEOAS` (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) is a constraint of the REST architectural style that allows you
to navigate and interact with an API by following hyperlinks provided by the API server. It helps to make your API more
discoverable and self-descriptive. While HATEOAS is not a standard feature in Laravel by default, you can implement it
in your Laravel 9 API with some additional code and design considerations.

Here are the steps to implement HATEOAS in your Laravel 9 APIs:

1. **Define Resource Classes**: Create resource classes that represent your API resources. These classes should extend
   Laravel's `JsonResource` or `Resource` class and define how each resource should be presented in the API response.
   You can add hyperlinks in these resource classes.

```php
php artisan make:resource MyResource
`````

2. **Add Hyperlinks**: In your resource classes, add the `links` key in returned array to add hyperlinks to related resources. You can
   generate URLs using Laravel's route functions.

```php
   use Illuminate\Http\Resources\Json\JsonResource;

   class MyResource extends JsonResource
   {
       public function toArray($request)
       {
           return [
               'id' => $this->id,
               'name' => $this->name,
               'links' => [
            [
                'rel' => 'self',
                'href' => route('categories.show', $category->id)
            ],
            [
                'rel' => 'categories.buyers',
                'href' => route('categories.buyers.index', $category->id)
            ],
            [
                'rel' => 'categories.transactions',
                'href' => route('categories.transactions.index', $category->id)
            ],
            [
                'rel' => 'categories.sellers',
                'href' => route('categories.sellers.index', $category->id)
            ],
            [
                'rel' => 'categories.products',
                'href' => route('categories.products.index', $category->id)
            ],

        ]
            
           ];
       }
   }
````

3. **Use Named Routes**: Make sure to use named routes in your resource classes to generate URLs. Define these routes in
   your `web.php` or `api.php` routes file.

```php
   Route::get('/myresource/{id}', 'MyResourceController@show')->name('myresource.show');
````

4. **Return Resources in API Responses**: In your API controllers, use the resource classes to format the API responses.

```php
   use App\Http\Resources\MyResource;

   public function show($id)
   {
       $myResource = MyModel::find($id);
       return new MyResource($myResource);
   }
````

5. **Document Hypermedia Links**: In your API documentation, be sure to document the hypermedia links that are available
   for each resource. You can use tools like Swagger or OpenAPI for this purpose.

6. **Client Implementation**: Clients consuming your API should be designed to follow these hyperlinks in the responses
   to navigate through the API.

Implementing HATEOAS in Laravel requires careful design and consistent use of resource classes and named routes to
generate hyperlinks. It can make your API more user-friendly and discoverable, especially in complex API ecosystems.
