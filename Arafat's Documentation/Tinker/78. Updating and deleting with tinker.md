- to update a row we have first to get that row using method `find()`

````php
$post = App\Models\Post::find(1)
````

- Then we can update each attribute separately

````php
$post->title = "updated title using tinker"
````

- Then

````php
$post->content = "updated content using tinker"
````

- then save the updated row

````php
$post->save()
````

### delete a row

- remember when we have created a column called `deleted_at`
  it is used to indicated that this row is in trash, we won't be able to delete the row
  normally we have to use a method to permanently delete it

````php
$post->delete()
````

> Output: `true`

- to get rows in trash

````php
$GetTrashedRows = App\Models\Post::onlyTrashed();
````

- To delete permanently trashed rows

````php
$GetTrashedRows->forceDelete() 
````

> Output: `3`, number of deleted rows
