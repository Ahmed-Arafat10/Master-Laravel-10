### Cache In Laravel
````php
Route::get('/cache', function () {

    $Admin = \App\CIC\Admin\Models\Admin::all();

    # add a cache
    Cache::put('AdminDataCached', $Admin, 10);

    # get cache value with specific key
    echo Cache::get('AdminDataCached');

    # remove a key in cache
    Cache::forget('AdminDataCached');

    # remove all keys in cache
    Cache::flush();
    
    # create a forever cache
    Cache::forever('Admin', $Admin);

    # create a temporary cache with closure method valid for 10 Minutes
    Cache::remember('AttendanceTemp', 10, function () {
        return Attendance::orderBy('Date', 'DESC')->get();
    });

    # create a forever cache with closure method
    Cache::rememberForever('AttendanceForever', function () {
        return Attendance::orderBy('Date', 'DESC')->get();
    });
});

### Q1: ChatGPT: what is cache in laravel
In Laravel, caching is a mechanism for storing data in memory or in a persistent storage medium such as a file system or a database. The purpose of caching is to reduce the number of requests made to an application's data source, by storing frequently used data in a faster and more accessible location.

Laravel provides a unified caching API that supports various caching drivers, including in-memory, file, database, and Redis-based caching. The caching API provides a simple and consistent way to read and write data to the cache, using a common set of methods such as `get`, `put`, `has`, and `forget`.

Here is an example of using the Laravel cache API to store and retrieve a value from the cache:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Cache;

$value = Cache::get('key');

if ($value === null) {
    $value = // retrieve value from data source
    Cache::put('key', $value, $expiration);
}

return $value;
```

In this example, the `get` method is used to retrieve a value from the cache, and if the value is not found, it is retrieved from the data source and stored in the cache using the `put` method.

Laravel's caching API also supports features such as cache tags, which allow you to group related cached items together and selectively remove them from the cache, and cache locks, which allow you to prevent race conditions when multiple processes attempt to access the same cached data simultaneously.

Overall, caching in Laravel is a powerful mechanism for improving application performance by reducing the number of database queries and other expensive operations, and it is an important tool for building scalable and efficient applications.

### Q2: what is cache::remember()
In Laravel, the `Cache::remember()` method is a convenient way to retrieve a value from the cache or generate it and store it in the cache if it does not exist. This method takes two arguments: a key that identifies the cached value, and a closure that generates the value if it does not exist in the cache.

Here is an example of using the `Cache::remember()` method to retrieve a value from the cache or generate it and store it in the cache:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Cache;

$value = Cache::remember('key', $expiration, function () {
    return // generate value
});
```

In this example, the `remember` method is used to retrieve a value from the cache with the key `'key'`. If the value is not found in the cache, the closure function is executed to generate the value, which is then stored in the cache with the specified expiration time. The `remember` method returns the cached value, whether it was retrieved from the cache or generated by the closure.

The `Cache::remember()` method provides a convenient way to perform caching operations with a single method call, without having to check if the cached value exists and generate it manually if it does not. This can simplify your code and make it more readable, while still taking advantage of the benefits of caching to improve application performance.

Overall, the `Cache::remember()` method is a powerful tool for working with the Laravel cache, and it is widely used in Laravel applications to improve performance and reduce database queries.

### Q3: what if I want it permanent using the above method
If you want to store the value permanently using the `Cache::remember()` method, you can set the expiration time to a very high value, or use the `Cache::forever()` method instead.

Here is an example of using the `Cache::forever()` method to store a value permanently in the cache:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Cache;

$value = Cache::rememberForever('key', function () {
    return // generate value
});
```

In this example, the `rememberForever` method is used to retrieve a value from the cache with the key `'key'`. If the value is not found in the cache, the closure function is executed to generate the value, which is then stored permanently in the cache using the `forever` method. The `rememberForever` method returns the cached value, whether it was retrieved from the cache or generated by the closure.

The `Cache::forever()` method is similar to the `Cache::remember()` method, but it stores the value in the cache permanently, without an expiration time. This can be useful for caching data that does not change frequently and does not need to be refreshed periodically.

Note that storing data permanently in the cache can have implications for your application's memory usage and performance, especially if the data is large or if there are many such values stored in the cache. Be sure to consider the trade-offs carefully when deciding to store data permanently in the cache.

### Q4: if the data is changed in the database does the cache data change
No, if the data is changed in the database, the cached data will not change automatically. This means that if you are using caching in your application, you need to have a strategy in place for invalidating or updating the cache when data changes.

One common approach is to use cache tags in Laravel. Cache tags allow you to group related cached values together, and then invalidate or update all cached values with a particular tag when the data changes. Here's an example of how to use cache tags in Laravel:

```php
// Store the data in the cache with a tag
Cache::tags(['my_tag'])->remember('my_key', $expiration, function () {
    return // get data from the database
});

// Invalidate all cached values with the tag when the data changes
DB::table('my_table')->where('id', $id)->update($data);
Cache::tags(['my_tag'])->flush();
```

In this example, the data is stored in the cache using the `Cache::tags()` method to assign a tag to the cached value. This tag can then be used to invalidate or update all cached values with the same tag when the data changes. To do this, you can use the `flush()` method to remove all cached values with the specified tag.

Note that cache tags can be a powerful tool for managing cached data, but they can also add complexity to your application. Be sure to consider the trade-offs carefully when deciding whether to use cache tags or other caching strategies in your Laravel application.
