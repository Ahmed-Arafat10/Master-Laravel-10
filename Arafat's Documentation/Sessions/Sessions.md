#### Q1: Session::flash() vs Session::put() in laravel 9
In Laravel 9, both `Session::flash()` and `Session::put()` are used to store data in the session. However, they have different purposes.

`Session::put()` is used to store data in the session for the long term. This means that the data will be available in the session until it is manually removed or until the session expires.

On the other hand, `Session::flash()` is used to store data in the session for the short term. This means that the data will only be available in the session for the next request, after which it will be automatically removed from the session.

`Session::flash()` is commonly used to store success or error messages to be displayed to the user on the next page load. For example:

```php
Session::flash('success', 'Your profile has been updated successfully.');
```

This message will be available in the session for the next request, after which it will be automatically removed.

`Session::put()` is used to store data that needs to be persisted across requests, such as user preferences or settings. For example:

```php
Session::put('user.timezone', 'America/New_York');
```

This data will be available in the session until it is manually removed or until the session expires.

In summary, `Session::flash()` is used for short-term storage of data that only needs to be available for the next request, while `Session::put()` is used for long-term storage of data that needs to be persisted across requests.

#### Q2: so now whether ->with() method is long term or short term session
The `->with()` method in Laravel is used to add data to the session flash data, which means that the data will be available in the session for the short term, i.e., only for the next request.

For example, when you redirect a user to a new page after submitting a form, you can use the `->with()` method to flash a success message to the user that will be available on the next request:

```php
return redirect()->route('dashboard')->with('success', 'Your profile has been updated successfully.');
```

In this case, the 'success' message will be available in the session only for the next request. Once the user loads the next page, the message will be removed from the session.

So to answer your question, the `->with()` method is used for short-term session storage.

#### Q3: okay now that is the difference between Session::put() and session()->put() in laravel 9
In Laravel 9, there is no functional difference between `Session::put()` and `session()->put()` because both methods are used to store data in the session for the long term.

`Session::put()` is a static method that is provided by the `Illuminate\Support\Facades\Session` facade. It can be used anywhere in your Laravel application by importing the Session facade, like so:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Session;

Session::put('user.timezone', 'America/New_York');
```

On the other hand, `session()->put()` is a helper function that is provided by Laravel's global helper functions. It can be used anywhere in your Laravel application without the need to import any facade, like so:

```php
session()->put('user.timezone', 'America/New_York');
```

Both methods will store the 'America/New_York' value under the 'user.timezone' key in the session, which will be available for the long term until it is manually removed or the session expires.

In summary, there is no functional difference between `Session::put()` and `session()->put()` in Laravel 9. You can use either of them based on your preference or coding style.
