#### Q4: what is Laravel's global helper functions
Laravel's global helper functions are a set of functions that are available globally throughout your Laravel application without requiring any imports or namespaces. These functions can be accessed from anywhere in your application, including within controllers, views, and routes.

Some of the commonly used global helper functions in Laravel include:

1. `app()`: Returns the application instance.

2. `config()`: Returns the value of the specified configuration variable.

3. `env()`: Returns the value of the specified environment variable.

4. `route()`: Generates a URL for the specified named route.

5. `view()`: Returns a new instance of a view.

6. `abort()`: Throws an HTTP exception with the specified status code.

7. `redirect()`: Creates a new redirect response to the specified URL.

8. `session()`: Returns an instance of the session manager.

9. `collect()`: Creates a new collection instance.

10. `request()`: Returns the current request instance.

These global helper functions provide a convenient way to perform common tasks in your Laravel application without the need to import or create instances of classes. However, it's worth noting that overuse of these functions can lead to code that is harder to read and maintain, so it's important to use them judiciously.

#### Q5: i want a code example on points 1,2,3,6,9 please
Certainly! Here are some code examples that demonstrate the usage of the global helper functions in Laravel:

1. `app()`

The `app()` function returns an instance of the application container, which can be used to resolve dependencies or fetch instances of registered services:

```php
$myService = app()->make(MyService::class);
```

2. `config()`

The `config()` function returns the value of a specified configuration variable. For example, to retrieve the value of the `app.timezone` configuration variable:

```php
$timezone = config('app.timezone');
```

3. `env()`

The `env()` function returns the value of a specified environment variable. For example, to retrieve the value of the `DB_HOST` environment variable:

```php
$dbHost = env('DB_HOST');
```

6. `abort()`

The `abort()` function is used to throw an HTTP exception with the specified status code. For example, to abort the current request with a 404 status code:

```php
abort(404, 'Page not found');
```

9. `request()`

The `request()` function returns the current request instance, which can be used to retrieve data from the request, such as input values or file uploads:

```php
$name = request()->input('name');
$file = request()->file('image');
```

Note that the `request()` function can also be used to create a new instance of a `Illuminate\Http\Request` object, like so:

```php
$request = request()->create('/my-url', 'POST', ['name' => 'John']);
```

I hope these examples help illustrate how the global helper functions can be used in your Laravel application!
